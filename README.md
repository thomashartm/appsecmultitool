# AppSecMultitool

AppSecMultitool identifies potential sinks by passing 
identifiers into sources. 

It uses puppeteer to communicate with the target and to evaluate 
the identifiers which are reflected into the dom.

**Development**

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.
